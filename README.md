# Meme Generator

Simple meme generator developed with Python & Flask.
This project is for the BETA nanodegree **Intermediate Python** at Udacity that I am testing to become a mentor and project reviewer once it gets released.

## Installation

Download to your project directory, add `README.md`, and commit:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:carlosloureda/meme-generator.git
cd meme-generator
```

## Starter Code Overview

We've provided some code and data to get you started. Sample quotes and images of Xander the pup in `src/_data/`.

There's also a basic flask server which will consume your modules and make it usable through a web interface. The main code for this flask service is in `app.py`, templates are in `templates/` and generated images should be saved to `static/`. You'll need to install the flask dependency with `pip install flask` and you can run the server with `python3 app.py`.

## Usage

<!-- TODO: WIP -->

## Learn

- Interact with a variety of complex filetypes. This emulates the kind of data you’ll encounter in a `data engineering role`.
- Load quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF, Word Documents, CSVs, Text files).
- Load, manipulate, and save images.
- Accept dynamic user input through a command line tool and a web service. This emulates the kind of work you’ll encounter as a `full stack developer`.

We will cover the learned topics on the course:

- Object-oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
- DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principles of class and method design.
- Working with modules and packages in Python.

This project starts from a [starter code repository](https://github.com/udacity/PYND/tree/master/02_meme_gen_starter) provided by Udacity.
For those users that have access to the nanodegree, here is a direct [link to the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2709/view) for this project

## Arquitecture

This project focuses in 3 main `modules`:

- Quote Engine Module
- Meme Generator Module
- Main Application
